## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.10.0 or higher
- Dart 3.0 or higher
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)
- Appwrite server instance (for backend)
- OSRM server instance (for routing)

### Installation

1. *Clone the repository*
   
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bantaybayan
   

2. *Install dependencies*
   
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   

3. *Configure environment variables*
   Create a .env file in the project root:
   
env
   APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-server.com/v1
   APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   OSRM_BASE_URL=https://your-osrm-server.com
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
   

4. *Run the app*
   
   flutter run

// User management
final user = authService.currentUser;
await authService.logout();

### ApiService
Manages API calls to Appwrite backend:
// Get flood reports
final reports = await ApiService.getReports();

// Submit new report
await ApiService.submitReport(reportData);

// Get weather data
final weather = await ApiService.getCurrentWeather(lat, lon);

### OfflineCacheService

// Cache map tiles
await cacheService.cacheTilesForArea(center, radiusKm);

// Cache routes
await cacheService.cacheRoute(start, end, coordinates);

// Retrieve cached data
final cachedTiles = await cacheService.getCachedTiles(bounds);

### RoutingService
Calculates routes using OSRM:
// Find primary route
final route = await RoutingService.findRoute(start, destination);

// Find alternative routes
final routes = await RoutingService.findAlternativeRoutes(start, destination);

### MLPredictionService
Runs TensorFlow Lite models for flood prediction:
// Predict flood probability
final prediction = await MLPredictionService.predictFloodProbability(
  latitude, longitude, rainfall
);
